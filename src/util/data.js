export const sampleQuestion = `Machine Learning involves training models to make predictions or decisions based on data. One common type of machine learning is {{blank_1}}, where the model is trained on labeled data. Another type is {{blank_2}}, which involves training models on data without explicit labels. In ML, {{blank_3}} is a crucial step that involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. Additionally, {{blank_4}} learning is a technique where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.`
